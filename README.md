Very simple C program which is allowing user to maintain data stored in a text files. With this program you can learn how to:

___________________________________
- Display user a menu to edit data.
- Add data to the file.
- Amend data in a file of requested data given by a user.
- Delete (hide) data from the file. So it won't be read anymore.
- Restore (show after deleteing) data back to the text file.
- Print details of given data when prompted.
- How to create a text file in a specified location.

___________________________________
Additional documentation of the script can be found in the main repository.

Program has been written back in 2013 for my school purposes. Code is an Open Source, you can edit it, share it however you want, but credits of the original author are a MUST.
